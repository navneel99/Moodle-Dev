# Moodle-Dev

This is the Mini-Moodle cum registration app as required by Dev Club Recruitment.

This project uses:
1. php
2. mysql

I don't know how to add php and mysql, so I added the files so it can be run locally.
the ".sql" file creates the database Moodle and the tables required.

PLEASE NOTE THAT A file "rootpass.php" is missing. It is required to be added by the one testing it.

It'll contain the username and password for mysql root user for your local machine.
Please check any php file to see what are the variable names for the 'user' and the 'password'
