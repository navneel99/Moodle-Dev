# Moodle-Dev

This is the Mini-Moodle cum registration app as required by Dev Club Recruitment.

This project uses:
1. php
2. mysql

Deploying php and mysql was becoming a problem, so I added the files so it can be run locally.
the ".sql" file creates the database Moodle and the tables required.

#PLEASE add your root username and password in the rootpass.php file for it to work.
#It'll contain the username and password for mysql root user for your local machine.
#Please check any php file to see what are the variable names for the 'user' and the 'password'.
#Don't forget it to keep the files in a folder named 'Moodle"in Apache html  folder.
